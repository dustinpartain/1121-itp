# ITP Week 2 Day 2 Exercise

#Write a basic calculator using the input function to complete the following tasks.  Be sure to call your functions at the end, using the correct arguments.

# Easy Tasks(complete all 3):
#     - A function that subtracts one integer from another
#     - A function that multiplies three integers
#     - A function that adds four integers

# Medium Task: 
#     - Create a calculator function using THREE input parameters (two float, one string[hint: it will be a math symbol]) to allow the user to add, substract, multiply and divide.

# Difficult Task: 
#     - You're at a restaurant with some friends and the server didn't split up the check.  Create a function that takes a bill amount, multiplies it by a global variable called tax_rate, adds the tax, and then divides the total bill by the number of people input by the user.  BONUS:  Include an option for adding tip through either a percentage amount assigned to a global varible, or through a specific amount input by the user.
